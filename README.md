**For BD and Vencord:**

Drag the theme file from downloads to either
- BetterDiscord: `%appdata%\betterdiscord\themes`
- Vencord: `%appdata%\vencord\themes`

## Building from source

To build the theme from source, you can simply run `npm install` to install all missing dependencies and `npm run build` to compile the theme into the `/public` folder.

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of NodeJS.
Basic knowledge of SCSS/CSS.
Basic knowledge of Git/GitHub.
Basic knowledge of the terminal/command prompt.
Install Dependencies:
Open a terminal/command prompt and use the following command: npm install in the FrostedGlass folder.

## Development

Run the `dev` script with: `npm run dev`.  
This will watch for changes inside the `/src` folder and then auto compile them into your BetterDiscord themes folder.
